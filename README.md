# Fraud_Detection
This model aims at detecting fraudulent transactions through credit card.
The code creates two separate DataFrames: fraud contains rows where the 'Class' column is equal to 1 (representing fraud transactions), and not_fraud contains rows where the 'Class' column is equal to 0 (representing non-fraud transactions).
Logistic Regression algorithm is used to implement the above model.
